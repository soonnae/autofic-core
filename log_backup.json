Unsanitized input from a remote resource is used in the `logger.spawn` function, which could lead to command injection if the input is used to build a shell command.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nTo mitigate the risk of command injection, ensure that any input used in shell commands is properly sanitized or escaped. In this context, ensure that the `movie.title`, `movie.year`, `release.title`, and `file` are properly sanitized before being used in `logger.spawn`.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe `sanitizeInput` function is added to ensure that only alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces are allowed in the input used for logging. This helps prevent command injection by sanitizing potentially harmful characters.\n\n### 2. `server/store/server.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 4 | HttpToHttps | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/store/server.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code uses the `http.createServer` method, which relies on the HTTP protocol. HTTP is insecure as it transmits data in cleartext, making it susceptible to interception by unauthorized parties.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nSwitch from using the `http` module to the `https` module, which provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting the data.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that you have the necessary SSL/TLS certificates configured for the `https` server to function correctly. This typically involves providing options with key and cert properties when calling `https.createServer`.\n\n### 3. `src/utils/palette.worker.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 3 | InsufficientPostmessageValidation | 💡 NOTE |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `src/utils/palette.worker.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code lacks validation of the origin of the received message in the `addEventListener` for the 'message' event. This means any site, including potentially malicious ones, can send messages to this window.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a check to validate the origin of the incoming message to ensure it comes from a trusted source before processing it.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nReplace `'https://trusted-origin.com'` with the actual origin you expect to receive messages from. This ensures that only messages from a trusted source are processed.\n\n### 4. `server/controllers/production.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 17~28 | NoRateLimitingForExpensiveWebOperation | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/controllers/production.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code performs a file system operation within an endpoint handler without any rate-limiting mechanism. This can lead to potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks if an attacker sends a large number of requests in a short period.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a rate-limiting middleware to restrict the number of requests to the endpoint within a specified time frame.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe `express-rate-limit` package is used to implement rate limiting. Ensure that this package is installed in your project by running `npm install express-rate-limit`. The rate limiter is set to allow 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP, which can be adjusted based on the application's needs.\n\n### 5. `server/store/sessions.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 28 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/store/sessions.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack because it directly uses unsanitized file names from the filesystem to construct paths for `fs.stat`. This could allow an attacker to manipulate file paths and potentially access unauthorized files or directories.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nValidate and sanitize the file names before using them to construct paths. Ensure that the file names do not contain any path traversal characters like `../`.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe use of `path.basename()` ensures that only the file name is used, preventing any directory traversal attempts. This fix is minimal and preserves the original structure and functionality of the code.\n\n### 6. `server/api/grab.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 31 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/grab.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code leaks error details to the client by sending the error object directly in the response. This can expose sensitive information about the server or the application logic.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nInstead of sending the error object directly, send a generic error message to the client. Log the detailed error message on the server for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe detailed error information is still logged on the server side, which is useful for debugging purposes. The client receives a generic error message, which helps prevent information leakage.\n\n### 7. `server/api/plex.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 59 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/plex.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe error object is directly sent to the client, which may contain sensitive information about the server's internal state or configuration. This can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nInstead of sending the entire error object, send a generic error message to the client. Log the detailed error information on the server for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nBy logging the detailed error information on the server, developers can still diagnose issues without exposing sensitive details to the client.\n\n### 8. `server/api/trigger.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 18 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 26 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/trigger.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code leaks detailed error information to the client by sending the error object `err` in the response. This can expose sensitive information about the server's internal workings.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nReplace the detailed error information with a generic error message in the response to the client, while still logging detailed errors internally for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that the logging system is secure and that logs are not exposed to unauthorized users, as they will contain the detailed error information needed for debugging.\n\n### 9. `server/controllers/proxy.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 13 | Ssrf | 🛑 ERROR |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/controllers/proxy.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it directly uses a URL from the user input (`req.query.url`) without proper validation or sanitization.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a whitelist mechanism to validate the URL against a list of allowed origins before making the request. This ensures that only requests to trusted URLs are permitted.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe original code had a commented-out block that implemented a URL whitelist check. By uncommenting this block, the code now validates the URL against a list of allowed origins, mitigating the SSRF vulnerability.",

Special characters need to be specifically escaped.\n   - Web Cookie Secure Disabled By Default: The code sets cookies without the `Secure` attribute, which makes them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- For Improper Code Sanitization, avoid using `eval` and use safer alternatives like `JSON.parse` or other parsing methods that do not execute code.\n   - For Web Cookie Secure Disabled By Default, ensure that cookies are set with the `Secure` attribute to enforce transmission over HTTPS only.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\n- The use of `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(t))` is a placeholder to indicate that `eval` should be avoided. In practice, ensure that the data being handled is properly sanitized and validated before use.\n   - The `Secure` attribute for cookies is added to ensure they are only transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.\n\n### 2. `res/wx20160629.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 2246 | ImproperCodeSanitization | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 4072 | WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault | 💡 NOTE |\n| 4079 | WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault | 💡 NOTE |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `res/wx20160629.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\n- The code is vulnerable to improper code sanitization, where data flows into `eval` are incorrectly sanitized using `JSON.stringify`. This method is inappropriate for defending against this kind of vulnerability because special characters need to be specifically escaped.\n   - The code also has a vulnerability related to cookies, where the Secure attribute is not set. This leaves the cookie susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- For the improper code sanitization, ensure that data passed to `eval` is properly sanitized by escaping special characters or avoiding the use of `eval` altogether.\n   - For the cookie vulnerability, set the Secure attribute to true to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\n- The `eval` function has been replaced with `new Function()` to execute code safely. This is a safer alternative as it does not have access to the local scope.\n   - The Secure attribute for cookies has been added to ensure they are only sent over HTTPS connections.",

Other vulnerabilities such as command-line injection, unvalidated URL redirection, and XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities should also be addressed by using appropriate libraries or input validation techniques.\n\n### 2. `views/app/products.ejs`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level | CWE |\n|----|----|-----|---|\n| 20 | xss | 🛑 ERROR | CWE-079 |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `views/app/products.ejs`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the direct insertion of user-provided values into the HTML without proper escaping. Specifically, the `output.searchTerm` is being rendered using `<%- %>`, which escapes HTML but can still be unsafe if the data contains JavaScript code.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nUse `<%= %>` instead of `<%- %>` to ensure that the output is HTML-escaped, preventing any potential script execution.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe change from `<%- %>` to `<%= %>` ensures that the `searchTerm` is properly HTML-escaped, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks. Always validate and sanitize user inputs on the server-side as an additional security measure.\n\n### 3. `server.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level | CWE |\n|----|----|-----|---|\n| 23~28 | clear-text-cookie | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-614 |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe session cookies are being sent without enforcing SSL encryption, which can expose sensitive information to attackers through man-in-the-middle attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nSet the `secure` flag of the session cookies to `true` to ensure that cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections. Additionally, consider using `httpOnly` to prevent client-side scripts from accessing the cookies.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that your application is running behind an HTTPS server for the `secure` flag to be effective. If you're using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache, make sure to configure it to handle SSL termination properly. Additionally, consider enabling the `trust proxy` setting if your application is behind a proxy to ensure correct handling of secure cookies.\n\n### 4. `routes/app.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level | CWE |\n|----|----|-----|---|\n| 6 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 10 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 26 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 30 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 44 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 52 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 52 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `routes/app.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code lacks rate limiting on routes that perform sensitive operations, such as authorization checks and system commands. This can lead to potential abuse through brute-force attacks or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement rate limiting on routes that handle sensitive operations to mitigate the risk of brute-force and DoS attacks.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe rate limiting is applied using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. The configuration limits each IP to 100 requests per 15-minute window. Adjust the `windowMs` and `max` values as needed based on the application's requirements and expected traffic.\n\n### 5. `routes/main.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level | CWE |\n|----|----|-----|---|\n| 6 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 10 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 14 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 32 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n| 36 | missing-rate-limiting | ⚠️ WARNING | CWE-770 |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `routes/main.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code lacks rate limiting on routes that involve authentication and password reset functionalities. This absence can lead to brute force attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly attempt to guess passwords or other sensitive information.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement rate limiting on sensitive routes such as login, registration, forgot password, and reset password to mitigate the risk of brute force attacks.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe rate limiting is applied using the `express-rate-limit` middleware. This ensures that the number of requests to sensitive routes is limited, reducing the risk of brute force attacks.

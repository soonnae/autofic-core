Unsanitized input from a remote resource is used in the `logger.spawn` function, which could lead to command injection if the input is used to build a shell command.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nTo mitigate the risk of command injection, ensure that any input used in shell commands is properly sanitized or escaped. In this context, ensure that the `movie.title`, `movie.year`, `release.title`, and `file` are properly sanitized before being used in `logger.spawn`.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe `sanitizeInput` function is added to ensure that only alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces are allowed in the input used for logging. This helps prevent command injection by sanitizing potentially harmful characters.\n\n### 2. `server/store/server.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 4 | HttpToHttps | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/store/server.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code uses the `http.createServer` method, which relies on the HTTP protocol. HTTP is insecure as it transmits data in cleartext, making it susceptible to interception by unauthorized parties.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nSwitch from using the `http` module to the `https` module, which provides a secure channel over an insecure network by encrypting the data.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that you have the necessary SSL/TLS certificates configured for the `https` server to function correctly. This typically involves providing options with key and cert properties when calling `https.createServer`.\n\n### 3. `src/utils/palette.worker.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 3 | InsufficientPostmessageValidation | 💡 NOTE |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `src/utils/palette.worker.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code lacks validation of the origin of the received message in the `addEventListener` for the 'message' event. This means any site, including potentially malicious ones, can send messages to this window.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a check to validate the origin of the incoming message to ensure it comes from a trusted source before processing it.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nReplace `'https://trusted-origin.com'` with the actual origin you expect to receive messages from. This ensures that only messages from a trusted source are processed.\n\n### 4. `server/controllers/production.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 17~28 | NoRateLimitingForExpensiveWebOperation | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/controllers/production.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code performs a file system operation within an endpoint handler without any rate-limiting mechanism. This can lead to potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks if an attacker sends a large number of requests in a short period.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a rate-limiting middleware to restrict the number of requests to the endpoint within a specified time frame.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe `express-rate-limit` package is used to implement rate limiting. Ensure that this package is installed in your project by running `npm install express-rate-limit`. The rate limiter is set to allow 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP, which can be adjusted based on the application's needs.\n\n### 5. `server/store/sessions.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 28 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/store/sessions.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code is vulnerable to a Path Traversal attack because it directly uses unsanitized file names from the filesystem to construct paths for `fs.stat`. This could allow an attacker to manipulate file paths and potentially access unauthorized files or directories.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nValidate and sanitize the file names before using them to construct paths. Ensure that the file names do not contain any path traversal characters like `../`.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe use of `path.basename()` ensures that only the file name is used, preventing any directory traversal attempts. This fix is minimal and preserves the original structure and functionality of the code.\n\n### 6. `server/api/grab.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 31 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/grab.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code leaks error details to the client by sending the error object directly in the response. This can expose sensitive information about the server or the application logic.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nInstead of sending the error object directly, send a generic error message to the client. Log the detailed error message on the server for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe detailed error information is still logged on the server side, which is useful for debugging purposes. The client receives a generic error message, which helps prevent information leakage.\n\n### 7. `server/api/plex.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 59 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/plex.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe error object is directly sent to the client, which may contain sensitive information about the server's internal state or configuration. This can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nInstead of sending the entire error object, send a generic error message to the client. Log the detailed error information on the server for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nBy logging the detailed error information on the server, developers can still diagnose issues without exposing sensitive details to the client.\n\n### 8. `server/api/trigger.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 18 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 26 | ServerLeak | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/api/trigger.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code leaks detailed error information to the client by sending the error object `err` in the response. This can expose sensitive information about the server's internal workings.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nReplace the detailed error information with a generic error message in the response to the client, while still logging detailed errors internally for debugging purposes.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that the logging system is secure and that logs are not exposed to unauthorized users, as they will contain the detailed error information needed for debugging.\n\n### 9. `server/controllers/proxy.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 13 | Ssrf | 🛑 ERROR |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server/controllers/proxy.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) because it directly uses a URL from the user input (`req.query.url`) without proper validation or sanitization.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nImplement a whitelist mechanism to validate the URL against a list of allowed origins before making the request. This ensures that only requests to trusted URLs are permitted.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe original code had a commented-out block that implemented a URL whitelist check. By uncommenting this block, the code now validates the URL against a list of allowed origins, mitigating the SSRF vulnerability.",

Special characters need to be specifically escaped.\n   - Web Cookie Secure Disabled By Default: The code sets cookies without the `Secure` attribute, which makes them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- For Improper Code Sanitization, avoid using `eval` and use safer alternatives like `JSON.parse` or other parsing methods that do not execute code.\n   - For Web Cookie Secure Disabled By Default, ensure that cookies are set with the `Secure` attribute to enforce transmission over HTTPS only.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\n- The use of `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(t))` is a placeholder to indicate that `eval` should be avoided. In practice, ensure that the data being handled is properly sanitized and validated before use.\n   - The `Secure` attribute for cookies is added to ensure they are only transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.\n\n### 2. `res/wx20160629.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 2246 | ImproperCodeSanitization | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 4072 | WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault | 💡 NOTE |\n| 4079 | WebCookieSecureDisabledByDefault | 💡 NOTE |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `res/wx20160629.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\n- The code is vulnerable to improper code sanitization, where data flows into `eval` are incorrectly sanitized using `JSON.stringify`. This method is inappropriate for defending against this kind of vulnerability because special characters need to be specifically escaped.\n   - The code also has a vulnerability related to cookies, where the Secure attribute is not set. This leaves the cookie susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- For the improper code sanitization, ensure that data passed to `eval` is properly sanitized by escaping special characters or avoiding the use of `eval` altogether.\n   - For the cookie vulnerability, set the Secure attribute to true to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\n- The `eval` function has been replaced with `new Function()` to execute code safely. This is a safer alternative as it does not have access to the local scope.\n   - The Secure attribute for cookies has been added to ensure they are only sent over HTTPS connections.",

Specifically, the `handposeWorkerCompileCmd` variable is constructed using `rollupPath` and `handPoseEsmBuildPath`, which are resolved paths that could potentially be manipulated if the environment or input is not properly controlled.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nUse a safer method to execute shell commands by avoiding direct string interpolation. Instead, pass the command and its arguments as separate elements in an array to `execSync`.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe fix involves constructing the command as an array of arguments and joining them with a space when passing to `execSync`. This approach reduces the risk of command injection by clearly separating command components. However, it is important to ensure that the paths used are not influenced by user input or untrusted sources.",

Additionally, the code uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, which can lead to data being transmitted in cleartext. Lastly, there is no rate limiting on the endpoint that serves files, which can be exploited for Denial-of-Service attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nDisable the `X-Powered-By` header by using the Helmet middleware. Use the `https` module instead of `http` to ensure secure data transmission. Implement rate limiting using a middleware like `express-rate-limit` to protect against excessive requests.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that you have the necessary SSL certificate and key files (`server.cert` and `server.key`) in place for HTTPS to work. Adjust the rate limiting parameters as needed based on your application's requirements.\n\n### 2. `index.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 53 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `index.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code takes unsanitized input from command line arguments and uses it directly in `fs.watchFile`, which can lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files by manipulating the file path.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nValidate and sanitize the input file path to ensure it does not contain any path traversal characters or patterns.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe fix involves normalizing the file path and removing any path traversal patterns using `path.normalize` and a regular expression. This ensures that the path used in `fs.watchFile` is safe and does not traverse outside the intended directory.\n\n### 3. `lib/simple.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 229 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 1239 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 644 | PrototypePollution | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 711 | PrototypePollution | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 721 | PrototypePollution | ⚠️ WARNING |\n| 735 | PrototypePollution | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `lib/simple.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\n- The code contains a Prototype Pollution vulnerability where unsanitized input from a remote resource is used to access properties of objects by name. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the prototype of objects, potentially leading to crashes, remote code execution, or logic bypasses.\n   - There is also a Path Traversal vulnerability where unsanitized input is used in file operations such as `fs.unlinkSync` and `fs.promises.writeFile`, allowing an attacker to delete or write arbitrary files.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- Ensure that all inputs used to access object properties are sanitized and validated.\n   - Validate and sanitize file paths before using them in file operations to prevent Path Traversal.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\n- The `path.join` function is used to sanitize file paths, ensuring that any path traversal attempts are thwarted by resolving the path to a safe location.\n   - The `path.basename` function is used to ensure that only the file name is used, preventing directory traversal.",

Lastly, there is a lack of type checking on user input, which could lead to application crashes or logic bypasses.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\n- Disable the \"X-Powered-By\" header using the Helmet middleware.\n   - Implement rate limiting on endpoints that perform expensive operations.\n   - Add type checking for user inputs to ensure they are of the expected type.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe changes include adding the Helmet middleware to hide the \"X-Powered-By\" header, implementing a basic rate limiter using `express-rate-limit`, and adding type checking for the `name` variable in the `/room` route to ensure it is a string.\n\n### 2. `public/static/js/create.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 25 | OR | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `public/static/js/create.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code contains an Open Redirect vulnerability because it directly assigns a URL from a remote resource to `window.location.href` without proper validation or sanitization.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nValidate the URL to ensure it is safe before redirecting. This can be done by checking if the URL is relative or matches a whitelist of allowed domains.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe fix ensures that only relative URLs are allowed for redirection, which mitigates the risk of Open Redirect attacks. If external URLs are necessary, consider implementing a whitelist of allowed domains and validate against it.",

This is insecure as it can be intercepted by unauthorized actors. Additionally, the server performs file system operations without any rate-limiting mechanism, which could lead to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nUse the `https` module instead of `http` to ensure encrypted communication. Implement a basic rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse of file system operations.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nTo fully implement HTTPS, you need to provide the paths to your SSL certificate and private key in the `https.createServer` options. Additionally, consider using a library like `express-rate-limit` to implement rate limiting for better protection against DoS attacks.\n\n### 2. `server.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 10 | PT | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `server.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code reads a file path from a command line argument and uses it directly in `fs.readFile`, which can lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability.

Further improvements could include validating the URL format or using a library to sanitize the input.\n\n### 4. `react-app/src/pages/patient/doctors.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 56 | DOMXSS | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `react-app/src/pages/patient/doctors.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe code is vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOMXSS) because it directly assigns a potentially unsanitized input from a React `useState` value into the `src` attribute of an `img` tag.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nSanitize the `src` attribute by ensuring it only accepts valid URLs. This can be done by using a library like `dompurify` to sanitize the URL before it is used in the `src` attribute.\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nEnsure that `dompurify` is installed in your project by running `npm install dompurify`. This library helps in sanitizing HTML to prevent XSS attacks.\n\n### 5. `react-app/src/pages/patient/edit-doctor.js`\n🔏 SAST Analysis Summary\n| Line | Type | Level |\n|----|----|-----|\n| 341 | DOMXSS | ⚠️ WARNING |\n\n 🤖 LLM Analysis Summary\n\n### 📄 `react-app/src/pages/patient/edit-doctor.js`\n#### 🔸 Vulnerability Description\nThe vulnerability arises from the use of `URL.createObjectURL(img)` to set the `src` attribute of an `img` element. This can potentially lead to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOMXSS) if an attacker is able to manipulate the file input to include malicious content.\n#### 🔸 Recommended Fix\nUse a safer method to handle image previews, such as validating the file type before creating an object URL, and ensure that the `img` element's `src` attribute is set only if the file is of an expected type (e.g., image/jpeg, image/png).\n#### 🔸 Additional Notes\nThe fix ensures that only valid image files (JPEG or PNG) are processed for preview, reducing the risk of executing malicious scripts.
